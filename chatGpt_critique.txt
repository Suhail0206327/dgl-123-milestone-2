comment on my css :

1. Use Semantic HTML Elements: Make sure you're using semantic HTML elements to structure your content. For example, instead of using a <div> with the class "header-main," you can use <header>. Semantically named HTML elements will improve accessibility and make your code more readable.

2. Combine Repeated Properties: You have multiple elements with properties like height: 100%;. Consider consolidating these common properties into a class that can be applied to multiple elements. This reduces repetition and makes it easier to make global changes.

3. CSS Comments: You have some commented-out CSS code. If it's not needed, remove it to keep your CSS file clean. If you plan to use it later, consider adding comments to explain its purpose.

4. Avoid Overly Specific Selectors: Some of your selectors are overly specific. For example, .header-logo p can simply be .header-logo if you want to apply styles to the whole logo section.

5. Use CSS Variables Consistently: You've already defined CSS variables for your color scheme, which is great. Make sure you consistently use these variables throughout your CSS to maintain a consistent design and make it easier to update your color scheme.

6. Responsive Design: Ensure your design is responsive. Test it on different screen sizes and devices to make sure it looks good everywhere.

7. Image Optimization: If you have large images like 'assets/home.png' or 'assets/harrypotter.jpg,' consider optimizing them for the web to reduce page load times.

Accessibility: Make sure your website is accessible. Ensure that there is sufficient contrast between text and background colors, and consider using ARIA attributes for better accessibility.
